# Anagram
# Requirements:
#   Write a function that returns a list of all the possible anagrams
#   given a word and a list of words to create the anagram with  
# Input:
#   'abba', ['baab', 'abcd', 'baba', 'asaa'] => ['baab, 'baba']
# Process:
#   Thoughts  - I would need to create every permutation of the given word and check the list for each one
#           example: 'a' in ['a', 'ab', 'c'] -> true, but would 'a' in 'ab' be true too? The answer is no
#       Naive approach: a possible naive approach is to sort each word and put each one in a dictionary with a list of the matching letters.
#       Approach 1: change each character in different arrangements and check if that character is in the list

# Naive approach
